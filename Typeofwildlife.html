            <h2>Hikadduwa Marine National Park</h2>
            <p>Hikkaduwa National Park is one of three maritime national parks in Sri Lanka. The national park has a surrounding coral reef with a high degree of biodiversity. The location was declared as a wildlife sanctuary on May 18, 1979, and it was upgraded to a nature reserve with extended land size on August 14, 1988. As the number of visitors grows, the deterioration of the coral reef will intensify over the next 25 years. To alleviate the ecological effects, the reef was established as a national park on September 19, 2002.</p>

             <h2>Kumana National Park</h2>
             <p>This smaller and quieter reserve, formerly known as Yala East, is close to its much larger and more famous sibling, Yala National Park. It's an excellent site for birdwatching and safari expeditions. Kumana National Park is located on Sri Lanka's south east coast and is made up of wetlands and dry tropical forest, which are sustained by the park's 20 lagoons and tanks.

              Although there are fewer elephants, crocodiles, wild buffalo, and turtles than in Yala, there is still a high chance of seeing elephants, crocodiles, wild buffalo, and turtles. Leopards and about a dozen bears also live here, but seeing them is extremely rare. A 200-acre bird sanctuary on a rich mangrove swamp is one of Kumana's best attractions. Visitors can get a bird's eye view from watchtowers.
             
              <hr>The 18,149-hectare Kumana National Park, in Sri Lanka's southeast corner, is a well-known eco-tourism attraction and bird sanctuary where a variety of species breed and roost. The eastern portion of Yala National Park is Kumana National Park. The 'Kumana Villu,' a 200-hectare natural swamp lake fed by the 'Kumbukkan Oya' through a half-mile-long narrow channel, is one of the park's most notable attractions. In May and June, many water birds lay their eggs in this mangrove wetland. Birds such as pelicans, painted storks, spoonbills, white ibis, herons, egrets, and small cormorants are frequently seen.</p>

In addition, the website aims to inspire these individuals to protect and treat the Udawalawe National Park as if it were their own, so elevating the park to a more prestigious national asset of Sri Lanka.
              <hr>The mugger crocodile, spotted and barking deer, sambar , water buffalo, wild deer , and jackal are among the other interesting animals found in Udawalawe National Park, which also has approximately 200 kinds of birds.
